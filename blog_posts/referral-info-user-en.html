<p>
  At keycount, we build bridges between the countless islands in the financial
  sector - clear, interoperable, connected.
</p>

<p>
  Our goal is to give as many people as possible a secure and unique feeling when
  dealing with their bank accounts and cryptowallets.
</p>

<p >
  <b>Our app today: </b> with keycount you aggregate all your accounts, crypto
  wallets and exchanges and have a comprehensive overview of your finances.
</p>



<p >
  <b>Our app tomorrow: </b> payments will be interoperable (e.g. between PayPal
  and Revolut accounts) and easier than ever. Since you can link keycount to your
  social media profiles, you don't need to know your friends' bank details and can
  initiate payments with the click of a button.
</p>

<p>
  Because you are actively using our app and you and your personal environment
  should directly benefit from it, we have come up with some rewards for your
  referrals:
</p>


<ol >
  <li>You will receive 5 EUR per successful install* through your link paid
    monthly to your account as a thank you.</li>
  <li>After every 40 successful installs* through your personal link you will
    receive an additional bonus of 50 EUR each.</li>
  <li>We create a weekly ranking of all active Ambassadors. As soon as you are
    among the top 10 Ambassadors for 4 weeks, you will have the opportunity to
    advance to the next Ambassador level and receive an even greater financial
    benefit.</li>
