    <h2 id="4-implementation-of-the-services">4. implementation of the Services</h2>
    <p>4.1 Bank Data Aggregation &amp; Financial Analysis</p>
    <p>A prerequisite for using the services of the keycount app is the analysis of the bank account of the user
        (hereinafter referred to as &quot;financial analysis&quot;). The financial analysis is carried out in accordance
        with the following points:</p>
    <p>4.1.1 The necessary data for the financial analysis from the bank account (especially regular credits, SEPA
        direct debits as well as standing orders) can be retrieved via standardized interfaces in the financial industry
        (hereinafter referred to as &quot;bank interfaces&quot;) using XS2A, FinTS or the bank's own interfaces (e.g.
        dbAPI). These interfaces are defined in accordance with the EU-wide PSD2 Regulation and are accessed via the
        same security mechanisms as normal online banking access.</p>
    <p>4.1.2 In order for the data to be accessed via these banking interfaces, the user must first authenticate
        him/herself as the account holder to the banking interface using his/her online banking login data (e.g. account
        number and PIN) and also strong authentication by the customer (e.g. smsTAN). Then, depending on the bank, the
        transactions of the last 90-365 days are transmitted.</p>
    <p>4.1.3 keycount structures and categorizes the relevant direct debits, credit notes and standing orders from the
        transmitted turnover data. Categorization means that the turnovers are assigned to different expenditure items,
        such as living &amp; household or mobility.</p>
    <p>4.1.4 In addition to the turnover data, some bank interfaces offer the option that the personal information
        stored at the bank (e.g., first and last name, postal address, and e-mail address) is transmitted to us. The
        user must expressly consent to the transmission of this data.</p>
    <p>4.1.5 The use of the keycount app requires that the user has confirmed the Terms and Conditions and agreed to the
        separate <a href="https://keycountstorage.z1.web.core.windows.net/data-protection-policy-en.html">Privacy
            Policy</a> before authenticating with his/her mobile number.</p>
    <p>4.2 Transactions</p>
    <p>In order to use the services of the keycount app, the user's bank account must be connected. If the user uses the
        &quot;Open Banking&quot; services to initiate a payment from an account the user holds with another provider,
        the user must also give us the authority to initiate that payment. We will not store any of the sensitive
        payment information that the user provides in order to grant this authority. We will assume that the user has
        consented and authorized us to initiate payments from these accounts when the user elects to use a particular
        payment service in the keycount app and after the user has entered and submitted all required and requested
        information in the keycount app. The connection and payment services are made in accordance with the following
        points:</p>
    <p>4.2.1 The necessary data for the payment function from the bank account can be sent via standardized interfaces
        in the financial industry (hereinafter &quot;banking interfaces&quot;) using XS2A, FinTS or bank-owned
        interfaces (e.g. dbAPI). These interfaces are defined in accordance with the EU-wide PSD2 Regulation and are
        sent via the same security mechanisms as normal online banking access.</p>
    <p>4.2.2 In order for the data to be sent via these banking interfaces, the user must first authenticate him/herself
        as the account holder to the banking interface using his/her online banking login data (e.g. account number and
        PIN) and also strong authentication by the customer (e.g. smsTAN). Then, depending on the bank, the payment
        functionality is activated directly or a further confirmation is requested after the payment has been entered.
    </p>
    <p>4.2.3 keycount provides access to a platform that enables the direct entry and execution of payments from all
        connected bank accounts (provided the bank offers this functionality and is connected to keycount).</p>
    <p>4.2.4 Payment Execution: To send payments there is a function &quot;Transaction&quot;, this opens the transaction
        screen where the user selects: the bank account from which the transaction should be initiated, the amount, the
        name of the recipient and the purpose. The &quot;Scan&quot; function opens the camera, the user can additionally
        select whether he/she wants to scan an invoice, a credit card or a bank bill. If the operation fails, the user
        will be redirected to the transaction screen to enter the details manually. The &quot;Send to Friend&quot;
        function opens the transaction screen and automatically uses the default account stored by the receiving person
        as the recipient account. If the receiving person is not yet on the keycount app, they will receive an
        invitation to download the app.</p>
    <p>4.2.5 Receiving payments: With the functions &quot;Transfer with Link&quot; and &quot;Transfer with QR
        Code&quot;, keycount creates a one-time link to the payment data of a selected, connected account of the user.
        This can be sent and used by the other user to initiate a direct payment. Keycount links allow the user to send
        or receive payments from others. The keycount link or QR code can be shared by the user, so keycount payments
        can be received anywhere and by anyone with a valid bank account connected to keycount. Anyone who knows this
        keycount or account information can send a keycount payment to the user. Senders must add a description and
        enter the amount they wish to transfer. If they do not complete this process, no payment will be initiated.</p>
    <p>4.2.6 For peer-to-peer payments, the mobile number or social media nickname can be used to locate the other peer.
        Provided that the user approves access, the keycount app can access the existing contacts on social media or in
        the user's smartphone for such payments.</p>
    <p>4.2.7 The use of the payment functions of the keycount app requires that the user has confirmed the Terms and
        Conditions and agreed to the separate <a
            href="https://keycountstorage.z1.web.core.windows.net/data-protection-policy-en.html">Privacy Policy</a>
        prior to the first payment initiation.</p>
    <p>4.2 Crypto Data Aggregation</p>
    <p>A prerequisite for using the services of the keycount app is also the analysis of the user's crypto accounts and
        wallets (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Crypto Analysis&quot;). Cryptoanalysis is performed in accordance with
        the following points:</p>
    <p>4.3.1 The necessary data for the cryptoanalysis (especially crypto-transactions, exchange rates, account balances
        as well as account information) can be retrieved via interfaces (hereinafter &quot;crypto interfaces&quot;).</p>
    <p>4.3.2 In order for the data to be accessed via these crypto interfaces, the user must first authenticate
        himself/herself as an account/wallet holder to the crypto interface using his/her login data for the relevant
        exchange or wallet (e.g. e-mail address and password) and also strong authentication by the Customer (e.g.
        smsTAN or SecureID TAN). Then, depending on the provider, the data for the last 90-365 days is transmitted.</p>
    <p>4.3.3 In addition to the turnover/ and transaction data, some crypto interfaces offer the option that the
        personal information stored with the exchange or wallet (e.g. first and last name, postal address and e-mail
        address) is transmitted to us. The user must expressly consent to the transfer of this data.</p>
    <p>4.3.5 The use of the keycount app requires that the user has confirmed the Terms and Conditions and agreed to the
        separate <a href="https://keycountstorage.z1.web.core.windows.net/data-protection-policy-en.html">Privacy
            Policy</a> before authenticating with his/her crypto account/wallet.</p>
    <p>4.4 Use of In-App Support</p>
    <p>To report various problems as well as general support requests, there is the possibility to submit support
        requests directly in the keycount app. Support requests are submitted in accordance with the following points:
    </p>
    <p>4.4.1 The user can use the direct in-app function in the keycount app to submit a support request. To do so,
        he/she must leave his/her email address and a description of the problem.</p>
    <p>4.4.2 The use of the in-app support function of the keycount app requires that the user has explicitly confirmed
        the Terms and Conditions and agreed to the separate <a
            href="https://keycountstorage.z1.web.core.windows.net/data-protection-policy-en.html">Privacy Policy</a>.

    <h2 id="5-access-and-availability">5. Access and Availability</h2>
    <p>5.1 The legal capacity of the user is a prerequisite for the use of the keycount app.</p>
    <p>5.2 When installing (downloading) the keycount app on the smartphone, the user will be asked to enter the mobile
        number of the smartphone. This number is verified for security reasons. In the event of a change or deactivation
        of the mobile number, the user must immediately inform keycount GmbH of either the new mobile number or the
        deactivation of the keycount app.</p>
    <p>5.3 The services may be provided in whole or in part by a vicarious agent. In this case, the user will be made
        aware of the terms and conditions and the privacy policy of the vicarious agent when receiving the service and
        must accept them before the service is provided. In particular, keycount LLC works together with the following
        vicarious agents:</p>

        period of time.</p>
    <p>8.4 The contents, functions and requirements of the chargeable services at the time of the order as presented in

    <p>8.6 Right of revocation</p>
    <p>8.6.1 As a consumer, the User is entitled to a right of revocation in accordance with the following provisions
        when using chargeable services (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Contract&quot;):</p>

        is fourteen days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.</p>
    <p>To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us by means of a clear declaration (e.g. an e-mail) of your
        decision to withdraw from this contract. To comply with the revocation period, it is sufficient that you send
        the notification of the exercise of the right of revocation before the expiry of the revocation period.</p>
    <p>The revocation is to be sent to: keycount GmbH Rauchackerstrasse 37 8102 Oberengstringen Switzerland.</p>
    <p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:company@key-count.com">company@key-count.com</a></p>
    <p>Consequences of revocation</p>
    <p>In the event of an effective revocation, the services received by both parties must be returned. You are
        obligated to pay compensation for the services rendered up to the time of revocation if you were made aware of
        this legal consequence prior to submitting your contractual declaration and expressly agreed to our commencing
        the performance of the service in return before the end of the revocation period. If there is an obligation to
        pay compensation for lost value, this may mean that you still have to fulfill the contractual payment
        obligations for the period until the revocation. Your right of revocation shall expire prematurely if the
        contract has been completely fulfilled by both parties at your express request before you have exercised your
        right of revocation. Obligations to refund payments must be fulfilled within 30 days. The period begins for you
        with the dispatch of your revocation, for us with its receipt. The revocation may limit your scope of services,

    <p>The user agrees that keycount GmbH may begin to perform the contractual services prior to the expiration of the
        revocation period. In the event of a revocation, the user is obliged to pay compensation for the value of the
        services received in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>
    <p>End of the cancellation policy</p>
    <p>8.6.2 If keycount GmbH provides the user with certain chargeable services in full immediately after the order,
        the right of revocation shall expire if the user has given keycount GmbH his/her express consent to this and at
        the same time confirmed his/her knowledge that he/she loses his/her right of revocation upon complete
        fulfillment of the contract by keycount GmbH. The user's right of revocation shall also expire in the case of a
        contract for the delivery of digital content not on a physical data carrier if keycount GmbH has commenced
        performance of the contract after the user has expressly consented to keycount GmbH commencing performance of
        the contract prior to the expiry of the revocation period and the user has confirmed his/her knowledge that
        he/she loses his/her right of revocation through his/her consent upon commencement of performance of the
        contract. These points will be pointed out separately to the User in the corresponding services.</p>

        according to the content and purpose of this contract and its supplements, the fulfillment of which enables the
        proper execution of this contract and on the compliance of which the user regularly relies on and may rely on.
        The essential contractual obligations of this contract include in particular, but are not limited to, the
        services listed in section 3. The technical uninterrupted availability of the keycount app is not an essential
        contractual obligation.</p>
    <p>11.3 In the event of a breach of material contractual obligations (cardinal obligations), keycount LLC shall only
        be liable for the foreseeable damage typical for this type of contract if this damage was caused by simple
        negligence, unless it is a matter of claims for damages by the User(s) arising from injury to life, limb or
        health.</p>
    <p>11.4 The restrictions from clauses 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3 of the terms and conditions also apply in favor of the
        legal representatives and vicarious agents of keycount LLC, if claims are asserted directly against them.</p>
    <p>11.5 The limitations of liability resulting from clauses 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4 of the terms and conditions do
        not apply if keycount LLC has fraudulently concealed the defect or has given a guarantee for the quality of the
        item. The same applies insofar as keycount LLC and the user(s) have entered into a quality agreement.</p>
    <p>11.6 The regulations of the product liability law remain unaffected by the regulations in this clause 11 of the
        terms and conditions.</p>
    <p>11.7 keycount LLC is liable for the loss of data and programs and their recovery within the scope of this clause
        11 and only to the extent that this loss could not have been avoided by taking reasonable precautionary
        measures, in particular by making daily back-up copies of all data and programs.</p>
    <p>11.8 The user is obligated to immediately notify keycount LLC in writing of any damages in the sense of the above
        liability regulations or to have them recorded by keycount LLC, so that keycount LLC is informed as early as
        possible and can possibly mitigate the damages together with the user.</p>
    <h2 id="12-termination">12. Termination</h2>
    <p>12.1 keycount LLC may also terminate the entire business relationship or individual business relationships for
        which neither a term nor a deviating termination provision has been agreed upon at any time by giving reasonable
        notice. When calculating the period of notice, keycount LLC shall take into account the legitimate interests of
        the user(s).</p>
    <p>12.2 Termination of the entire business relationship or individual business relationships without notice is
        permissible if there is an important reason which makes it unreasonable for keycount LLC to continue the
        business relationship, even taking into account the legitimate concerns of the user. An important reason may
        exist in particular if the legal or regulatory requirements for the provision of or in connection with the
        services of the keycount app change. If the good cause consists of a breach of a contractual obligation,
        termination is only permissible after the unsuccessful expiry of a reasonable period set for remedial action or
        an unsuccessful warning, unless this is dispensable due to the particularities of the individual case (Section
        323 (2) and (3) of the German Civil Code).</p>
    <p>12.3 Subject to a separate agreement, the user is entitled to withdraw from the entire business relationship with
        keycount LLC at any time without notice. For this purpose, the user may irrevocably delete his/her user account
        within the keycount app.</p>
    <h2 id="13-miscellaneous">13. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>13.1 Applicable law</p>
    <p>13.1.1 These Terms and Conditions and all contracts and contractual rights and obligations concluded between
        keycount LLC and the user under these terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic
        of Germany, excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p>
    <p>13.1.2 All non-contractual rights and obligations arising from or in connection with these terms and conditions
        shall also be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
    <p>13.1.3 The statutory provisions on the restriction of the choice of law and on the applicability of mandatory
        provisions, in particular of the state in which the user has his habitual residence as a consumer, shall remain
        unaffected.</p>
    <p>13.1.4 If the user is a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, the place
        of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from contractual relationships between the user and keycount LLC is the
        registered office of keycount LLC.</p>
    <p>13.2 Changes to the terms and conditions</p>
    <p>13.2.1 keycount LLC reserves the right to change these terms and conditions and any special conditions at any
        time. Changes will be offered to the user in text form or via an electronic communication channel before the
        proposed date of their coming into effect. Each user shall have the right to either accept or reject the changes
        prior to their proposed effective date. The user shall be deemed to have given his/her consent if he/she has not
        indicated his/her refusal before the proposed date of entry into force of the changes. keycount LLC shall
        specifically draw the user's attention to this approval effect in its offer.</p>
    <p>13.2.2 If the user is offered changes to the terms and conditions of payment services (e.g. terms and conditions
        for credit transfers), he/she may terminate the payment services framework contract affected by the change
        without notice and free of charge prior to the proposed date on which the changes take effect. keycount LLC
        shall specifically draw the customer's attention to this right of termination in its offer.</p>
    <p>13.2.3 The contract remains binding in its remaining parts even if individual points are legally ineffective.
        Instead of the ineffective points, the legal regulations, if any, shall apply. However, insofar as this would
        represent an unreasonable hardship for one of the contracting parties, the contract as a whole shall become
        invalid.</p>
