<h2>What is special about keycount?</h2>
<p>Firstly, and very importantly, we are not a bank! Your money is never stored with us, neither digitally nor physically.</p>
<p>We are your new app for using and keeping track of all your bank accounts, cryptocurrencies and other financial apps.</p>
<p>…But do you really need another finance app?</p>
<p>Good question, here’s why you need keycount:</p>
<p>Through our unique way of connecting all your financial accounts (and finally having ONE overview), we
    enable mobile payments in a second step in a cheap and easy way – for everyone on EVERY platform!</p>
<p>Imagine a world where…</p>
<p>…it doesn’t matter where you are – real or digital: make mobile payments directly to all your contacts – phone or
    social media contacts – or pay via QR code with your mobile phone online and in-store. We leave all the possibilities to you!</p>
<p>Sounds good? Until everything is ready, sign up for our community list.</p>
<h2>When will the app including the payment function be available?</h2>
<p>The payment function is expected to be operational in summer 2023. The whole team is working hard to bring you the
    fully functional and innovative payment experience of the future.</p>
